This application is intended for a 7inch 800x400 screen. The application is made to be a desktop dashboard that updates:

- Date and time
- Weather and forecast
- Google Calendar

Dashboard requires user to have Google account and Tomorrow.io account. Must use OAuth2.0 to pull user data from google calendar.

All script is currently written in python.

May automate install process using bash for easy deployment.

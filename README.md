**v0.1.2-alpha Notes:**  
The dashboard application requires the user to have a Google account and a Tomorrow.io account. Must use OAuth2.0 to pull user data from google calendar and an API key to pull from Tomorrow.io. To sucessfully use the application in its current state, one must create a virtual environment in python and install all the necessary libraries (found in .py files). Go to google's API website and obtain your client_secret.json file and replace the client_secret.json file in the credentials folder. Now go to GUIgoogle.py file and change all of the directory paths in the authorize() to your preference. Make an account with Tomorrow.io and copy your API key into the GUIweather.py api_key variable and change the location variable to your desired city, state, and country. 

**Installation Guide:**

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Heisenberg-UP/Raspi-Dashboard.git
```

2. Move into the repository folder.
```bash
cd Raspi-Dashboard
```

3. Create a virtual python environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

4. Install dependencies through pip.
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

5. Go to Tomorrow.io, create an account and obtain an API key, then copy and paste your API key into the <api_key> variable in the widgets/GUIweather.py file on lines 16 and 55.

6. In the widgets/GUIweather.py file change the <location> variable on lines 19 and 58 to the desired city, state, and country. Additionally, you can change the <units> variable to "metric" if desired.

7. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com and make an account. Create and open a project called Google Calendar API, then navigate to the credentials tab. Follow the instructions to make an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Download the .json file and run the following command from your downloads folder:
```bash
cp *.json ~/Raspi-Dashboard/credentials/client_secret.json
```
Otherwise, copy the contents of your newly downloaded .json file and paste it into the credentials/client_secret.json file.

Coming soon:
- Calendar update function
- High resolution icons
- Night time weather icons
- Deployable bash script

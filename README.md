This application is intended for a 7inch 800x400 screen. The application is made to be a desktop dashboard that updates:

- Date and time
- Weather and forecast
- Google Calendar

Dashboard requires user to have Google account and Tomorrow.io account. Must use OAuth2.0 to pull user data from google calendar.

Coming soon:
- Calendar events displayed with event name
- High resolution icons
- Night time weather icons
- Deployable bash script... maybe

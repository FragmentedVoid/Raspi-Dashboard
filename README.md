# Raspi-Dashboard
**Raspberry Pi Dashboard Application v0.1.2-alpha**      
This application is intended for a 7inch 800x400 touchscreen. The application is a desktop dashboard that updates:
- Date and time
- Weather and forecast
- Google Calendar

This product is currently unfinished, and I am by no means a certified programmer. The product is quite janky and needs a lot of love. However, the application is functional... except the calendar portion is currently lacking an update feature. I plan on making the application more flush after I finish the foundation of the software.

Coming soon:
- Calendar update function
- High resolution icons
- Night time weather icons
- Deployable bash script

**Current Progress:**

5. Go to Tomorrow.io, create an account and obtain an API key, then copy and paste your API key into the <api_key> variable in the widgets/GUIweather.py file on lines 16 and 55.

6. In the widgets/GUIweather.py file change the <location> variable on lines 19 and 58 to the desired city, state, and country. Additionally, you can change the <units> variable to "metric" if desired.

7. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com and make an account. Create and open a project called Google Calendar API, then navigate to the credentials tab. Follow the instructions to make an OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Download the .json file and run the following command from your downloads folder:

   ```
   Otherwise, copy the contents of your newly downloaded .json file and paste it into the credentials/client_secret.json file.

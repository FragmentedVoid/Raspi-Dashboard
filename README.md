This application is intended for a 7inch 800x400 touchscreen. The application is a desktop dashboard that updates:

- Date and time
- Weather and forecast
- Google Calendar

Dashboard requires user to have Google account and Tomorrow.io account. Must use OAuth2.0 to pull user data from google calendar and an API key to pull from Tomorrow.io.

Coming soon:
- Calendar events displayed with event name
- High resolution icons
- Night time weather icons
- Deployable bash script... maybe
